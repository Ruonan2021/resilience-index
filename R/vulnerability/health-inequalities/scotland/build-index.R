# ---- Method ----
# The build method is adapated from the methods used to develop the Health Index
# for England. As the devolved nations versions of the Health Index are not
# measured across time, several aspects of the construction differ, and mirror
# those found in the Indices of Multiple Deprivation.

# Steps:
#   1. Scale (align) indicators so that higher value = worse health to align
#      with the other resilience indices (higher = worse).
#   x. Missing step: Apply functional transformations (e.g. log, square) to
#      address skewness in the distributions.
#   2. Weight the indicators within domains: Normalise to mean of 0 and SD +-1
#      and then apply MFLA.
#   3. Calculate domain scores: add weighted indicator scores and rank and
#      qunatise.
#   4. Combine domains with equal weighting to produce composite score: rank
#      and quantise output.
